# Project Instructions

## Task

All teams receive the same natural-language task:

> Find and sort cubes from the source area into their matching destination pads.

Teams must build one general LLM-assisted robot agent that can complete the task under randomized cube colors and randomized robot starting positions without source-code changes.

The LLM serves as the high-level task supervisor throughout execution. It decides what the robot should do next based on observations, memory, and recent action outcomes. Deterministic code should handle low-level perception, navigation, manipulation, validation, and safety.

## Environment

Each evaluation uses a static warehouse environment with:

- Cubes presented from the conveyor/cube source area
- Randomized cube colors
- Fixed destination pad locations
- Fixed destination signage and color backgrounds
- Fixed obstacle layout
- Fixed color-to-pad matching rules
- Randomized robot starting position

The fixed destination signage is:

| Sign | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| A | Conveyor/cube source area, not a destination pad |
| B with red background | Red cube destination |
| C with green background | Green cube destination |
| D with blue background | Blue cube destination |
| E with yellow background | Yellow cube destination |

At the start of each run, the cube queue is available at the conveyor/cube source area. Teams may choose any available cube to pick first, although picking the first available cube is usually the simplest strategy. After a cube is successfully picked, the system may present the next cube at the same pickup area.

## Project Levels

Teams may attempt one of three project levels. The selected project level contributes to the overall evaluation score.

### Level 0: Full-State Agent

Complete environment information is available through `scene_state`.

Students may use:

- `scene_state`
- Entity IDs such as `cube_2` or `pad_C`
- Entity-target navigation with `go_to`
- Camera observations, optionally

Students are expected to focus on:

- LLM task planning
- High-level decision-making
- Navigation using `go_to` with entity targets
- Pick and place execution
- Recovery from failed actions

No perception or localization is required.

Main challenge: design an LLM-driven task planner that solves the task using complete environment information.

Relevant codebase helpers include `menlo_runner.scene`, `menlo_runner.basics.go_to_entity`, and the Workshop 4 `WorkshopAgent` structure. When using raw SDK calls, entity navigation has this shape:

```python
result = await ctx.invoke(
    "go_to",
    {"target": {"kind": "entity", "entity_id": "pad_C"}},
    timeout_s=300,
)
```

### Level 1: Adaptive Navigation Agent

`scene_state` is not available.

Students must detect cubes and destination pads using camera observations. They are expected to:

- Detect targets visually
- Navigate toward targets
- Use manual robot movement with `set_velocity` to approach until pick/place succeeds
- Use coordinate-based `go_to` only after suitable coordinates have been estimated or recorded by the student system
- Optionally use memory to improve future navigation

Main challenge: combine perception, memory, coordinate estimation, navigation, and LLM reasoning to improve performance over time.

The current Level 1 starter is `menlo_runner/programs/project/en/level_1_starter.py`.

### Level 2: Autonomous Vision Agent

`scene_state` is not available. Coordinate-based `go_to` is not permitted.

Students must rely on camera observations and manual robot control for navigation. They are expected to:

- Detect and track cubes and destination pads
- Navigate using `set_head`, `set_velocity`, and closed-loop visual feedback
- Avoid obstacles
- Recover from failed navigation, target loss, and failed manipulation
- Use the LLM for high-level planning and decision-making

Main challenge: develop a fully autonomous vision-based navigation system capable of completing the task without coordinate-based navigation.

The current Level 2 starter is `menlo_runner/programs/project/en/level_2_starter.py`.

Closed-loop navigation should follow:

```text
observe -> move briefly -> observe again -> correct or stop
```

## Allowed Information

All submitted agents may use:

- Camera observations
- The natural-language task
- The fixed color-to-pad and sign-to-pad matching rules
- `robot_status`, including robot pose and neck state
- Action results
- Project-allowed SDK skills and helper functions
- LLM outputs for high-level decision-making

All project agents require both `MENLO_API_KEY` and `TOKAMAK_API_KEY` during development and evaluation. `MENLO_API_KEY` connects to the robot platform. `TOKAMAK_API_KEY` is required for the text LLM decision loop, and also for optional VLM calls.

By default, `menlo_runner.llm.call_llm(...)` uses `minimaxai/minimax-m3`. Teams may choose another approved model without editing package source code:

```python
import os

os.environ["MENLO_LLM_MODEL"] = "minimaxai/minimax-m3"
# Approved alternatives:
# os.environ["MENLO_LLM_MODEL"] = "minimaxai/minimax-m2.7"
# os.environ["MENLO_LLM_MODEL"] = "qwen/qwen3.6-35b-a3b"
```

For notebook users, put this in a cell after setup and before the agent starts. Local IDE users may set `MENLO_LLM_MODEL` in `.env` or pass `model=...` directly to `call_llm(...)`.

Additional information by level:

| Data source or capability | Level 0 | Level 1 | Level 2 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `scene_state` | Allowed | Not allowed | Not allowed |
| Exact entity IDs from the scene | Allowed | Not allowed | Not allowed |
| `go_to` with entity target | Allowed | Not allowed | Not allowed |
| `go_to` with student-estimated world pose | Allowed | Allowed | Not allowed |
| `set_velocity` | Allowed | Allowed | Allowed |
| `set_head` | Allowed | Allowed | Allowed |
| Camera observations | Allowed | Required | Required |
| Text LLM decision loop | Required | Required | Required |
| VLM observations | Optional | Optional | Optional |

Levels 1 and 2 must derive target information from camera observations and other allowed inputs. They must not use raw `scene_state`, ground-truth object coordinates, exact cube or pad entity IDs, or a global asset map.

Fixed action sequences that only work for one start pose or one cube-color setup are not allowed at any level.

## Required LLM Agent Structure

All teams must implement an LLM-assisted decision loop. The LLM must perform meaningful high-level reasoning rather than generating low-level robot commands.

The required execution loop is:

```text
observe -> decide -> validate -> act -> verify -> update memory -> continue
```

The LLM should make decisions such as:

- Selecting the next cube
- Prioritizing targets
- Choosing the next high-level action
- Determining recovery behavior after failed navigation, pick, or place actions
- Deciding whether to retry, skip, or stop
- Using memory to improve future decisions

Student code must validate every LLM response before execution.

Minimum response schema:

```json
{
  "next_action": "search_cube",
  "target_color": "red",
  "reason": "A red cube is visible and has not been attempted recently."
}
```

Allowed `next_action` values:

```text
search_cube
navigate_to_cube
pick_cube
search_pad
navigate_to_pad
place_cube
recover
skip_target
stop
```

`target_color` may be `null` when the action does not need a color. Additional fields such as `retry_limit`, `memory_update`, or `recovery_strategy` are permitted.

VLM usage is optional. Teams may use VLMs for richer scene understanding, including reading destination signs from camera frames. The required AI-agent component is still the structured text-LLM decision loop.

A single LLM call at the beginning is not enough. The LLM must participate during task execution, especially for target selection, recovery, skipping, and stopping.

## Natural-Language Task Input

The submitted agent must accept the natural-language task as input rather than hard-coding only the default objective.

Examples of useful memory fields include:

- `delivered_count`
- `held_color`
- `completed_colors`
- `failed_attempts`
- `recent_outcomes`

## Starter Code and Helpers

Students may use or adapt helpers from:

- `menlo_runner.scene`
- `menlo_runner.basics`
- `menlo_runner.perception`
- `menlo_runner.navigation`
- `menlo_runner.llm`
- `menlo_runner.agents`

Common SDK calls:

```python
# Camera frame and robot status
jpeg = await ctx.get_vision("pov")
status = await ctx.state("robot_status")

# Head aiming
await ctx.invoke("set_head", {"yaw": 0.5, "pitch": 0.2}, timeout_s=10)

# Short manual movement
await ctx.invoke(
    "set_velocity",
    {"vx": 0.25, "vy": 0.0, "wz": 0.0, "duration_s": 1.0},
    timeout_s=30,
)

# Cancel an active runtime action
await ctx.invoke("cancel", {})
```

Pick and place actions:

```python
# Pick the nearest intended cube after the robot has been positioned close to it.
pick_result = await ctx.invoke(
    "pick_entity",
    {"target": {"kind": "entity", "entity_id": "cube"}},
    timeout_s=300,
)

# Place on the nearest zone after the robot has reached the matching pad.
place_result = await ctx.invoke("place_entity", {}, timeout_s=300)
```

Level 0 entity navigation:

```python
result = await ctx.invoke(
    "go_to",
    {"target": {"kind": "entity", "entity_id": "pad_C"}},
    timeout_s=300,
)
```

Level 1 coordinate navigation:

```python
result = await ctx.invoke(
    "go_to",
    {
        "target": {
            "kind": "pose",
            "pose": {
                "frame_id": "world",
                "position": [x, y, 0],
            },
        }
    },
    timeout_s=300,
)
```

The `set_velocity` parameters are:

- `vx`: forward velocity in m/s
- `vy`: left velocity in m/s
- `wz`: yaw rate in rad/s
- `duration_s`: command duration in seconds

Commands are clipped to the trained policy ranges: `|vx|, |vy| <= 1.5`, `|wz| <= 0.6`. A new `set_velocity` command preempts any active `go_to` or `set_velocity` command.

Project-relevant helper functions:

- `menlo_runner.perception.detect_color_blobs(jpeg_bytes)`: detect colored blobs with centroid, bounding box, angle, and area.
- `menlo_runner.perception.perceive(ctx)`: capture the POV camera and return a compact color observation.
- `menlo_runner.perception.annotate_detections(jpeg_bytes)`: create a debug image with detections drawn on it.
- `menlo_runner.perception.estimate_depth_map(jpeg_bytes, depth_pipe)`: optional depth-estimation hook.
- `menlo_runner.navigation.center_on_color(ctx, target_color)`: baseline visual centering.
- `menlo_runner.navigation.drive_toward_color(ctx, target_color)`: baseline visual approach.
- `menlo_runner.navigation.my_go_to_visual(ctx, target_color)`: baseline visual navigation to a colored target.
- `menlo_runner.llm.call_llm(...)`: text LLM call for structured decisions.
- `menlo_runner.llm.ask_vlm(...)`: optional VLM call for scene or sign understanding.
- `menlo_runner.llm.parse_tool_call(...)`: parse JSON-like tool calls from model output.
- `menlo_runner.scene.visible_cubes(ctx)`: Level 0 helper for visible cube IDs, colors, and positions.
- `menlo_runner.scene.held_cube_info(ctx)`: Level 0 helper for the held cube.
- `menlo_runner.scene.delivered_cube_ids(ctx)`: Level 0 helper for delivered cube IDs.

Important restrictions:

- Level 0 may use `scene_state`, entity IDs, and entity-target `go_to`.
- Level 1 may use coordinate `go_to` only with coordinates estimated or recorded by the student system.
- Level 2 must not call `go_to`.
- `my_go_to_global` uses `scene_state` and exact entity IDs, so it is Level 0 only.
- The default `WorkshopAgent` is a learning example. It may be adapted for Level 0, but its default tools are not valid for Levels 1 or 2 because they use `scene_state` and exact entity IDs.

## Evaluation Setup

### Practice

Teams may develop and test using randomized cube-color orders and randomized robot starting positions.

### Interim Evaluation

The interim evaluation uses:

- One hidden cube-color configuration
- One hidden robot starting position

The published task remains:

> Find and sort cubes from the source area into their matching destination pads.

All teams within the same project level are evaluated using the same hidden setup.

No source-code changes are permitted during evaluation. Teams may use the results and feedback to improve their systems before the final evaluation.

### Final Evaluation

The final evaluation uses:

- A different hidden cube-color configuration
- A different hidden robot starting position

The published task remains:

> Find and sort cubes from the source area into their matching destination pads.

The final setup is different from the interim setup. No source-code changes are permitted during evaluation. Final results are used for judging.

## Common Requirements

All teams must:

- Accept the natural-language task as input.
- Use concepts from all four workshops.
- Implement the required LLM-assisted decision loop.
- Produce structured LLM outputs and validate them before execution.
- Verify execution outcomes using robot status, action results, and camera observations.
- Maintain execution logs containing observations, LLM decisions, executed actions, and outcomes.
- Recover appropriately from failed navigation, pick, and place actions.
- Demonstrate the robot behavior by running the project code during the interim and final presentations.
- Use presentation slides to summarize the required interim and final presentation topics.

## Evaluation Criteria

The final score is not capped at 100 points. Cube delivery points are earned within a 10-minute simulation run, and code quality and presentation points are added on top.

| Category | Evaluation metric | Points |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Cube Delivery | Successful deliveries within the 10-minute simulation run | Level-based, no maximum |
| 2. Code Structure and Quality | Judge review of source code and runtime behavior | Up to 10 |
| 3. Presentation | Theory, design decisions, robot behavior, reflection | Up to 10 |

### 1. Cube Delivery

Each successful cube delivery completed within the 10-minute simulation run earns points based on the team's selected project level. There is no cap on the number of cube deliveries that may count.

| Project level | Points per successful delivery |
| --- | --- |
| Level 0: Full-State Agent | 10 |
| Level 1: Adaptive Navigation Agent | 20 |
| Level 2: Autonomous Vision Agent | 30 |

Incorrect placements may reduce credit or terminate the run depending on the benchmark rules.

### 2. Code Structure and Quality: 10 Points

Judges award up to 10 points based on the submitted source code and observed runtime behavior.

### 3. Presentation: 10 Points

Teams should demonstrate their robot behavior by running the project code. Presentation slides should focus on the following summary topics rather than detailed implementation walkthroughs.

Interim presentation:

- Implemented robot action flow
- Role of the LLM
- Current successes and limitations
- Improvement plan

Final presentation:

- Complete robot action flow
- Role of the LLM
- Improvements since the interim presentation and limitations of the current system
- How the solution could be used or extended for real-world AI-agent-based robotics
